## Design Philosophy

These projects explore creative applications of structured formats, particularly the haiku's 5-7-5 syllable pattern, applied to various domains:

- **NATO Communications** - Military phonetic alphabet as poetic source material
- **Color Theory** - Mathematical color relationships expressed as visual haikus
- **Programming** - Code terminology transformed into artistic expression
- **Geometric Art** - Mathematical progressions and transformations
- **Interactive Design** - User engagement through real-time manipulation

## Technical Highlights

- **Responsive Design** - All projects work seamlessly across devices
- **Vanilla JavaScript** - No frameworks or dependencies required
- **CSS Animations** - Smooth transitions and engaging visual effects
- **Interactive Elements** - Real-time user input and dynamic content generation
- **Accessibility** - Keyboard navigation and screen reader friendly
- **Performance** - Lightweight and fast-loading applications
